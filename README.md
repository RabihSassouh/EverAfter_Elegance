###  EverAfter Elegance is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the GoLang programming language (https://golang.org/). GoLang is a statically typed, compiled programming language known for its simplicity and performance.
- For the frontend development, the project utilizes React.js (https://reactjs.org/), a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, combined with TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and improved developer experience.
- Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling the application. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with low-level utility classes.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/), a widely-used relational database management system that ensures reliable and efficient data management.
